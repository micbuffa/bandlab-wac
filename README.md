### Designing and deploying sample-based instruments

In this tutorial we will run through the process of creating a sample based MIDI instrument utilizing both Web Audio and Web MIDI. We will start by broadly addressing the sound design concepts used to create the individual samples and then techniques for increasing download speed using infinite looping and variable speed playback. We will then define the instrumentâ€™s basic user interface.

In the second half of the session we will address both real-time audio effects such as non-convolution reverbs and MIDI effects such as a simple arpeggiator and chord generator.
